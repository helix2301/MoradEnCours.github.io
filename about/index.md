## Background
I will progressively start to complete this section as I gain the inspiration to do so. For now, I am merely some random student that is trying to configure and write up his website.

This random student is progressively on his way to saturating their originally planned website with some interesting content. Just remember to:
> Ouvrez l'oeil

> Note:

* I am currently configuring a Linkedin profile but the site itself is very clunky to deal with.<br/>

* Likewise, I might make a discord account eventually.

* I will properly set up a YT account once I am ready to store video content that's worth saving.
